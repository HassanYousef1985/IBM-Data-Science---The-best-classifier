# The-best-classifier
This project is used for the Coursera course "PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE IBM Data Science"
I used  different Machine Learning algorithms,practiced and applied it on a dataset. In this project, I completed a notebook where I built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data. I used the following algorithms to build your models:
      k-Nearest Neighbour
      Decision Tree
      Support Vector Machine
      Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
      Jaccard index
      F1-score
      LogLoass
